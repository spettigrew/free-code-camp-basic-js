24 Mar 2020 - I started the very basic JS in free code camp about two weeks ago. I had only done about 10 out of the 110 then. I wanted to set this up to see how really far I've come. I know that with most of this, I am way more advanced, but it's been nice for the review and the practice. I'll do my best to give 100 days a code a shot. 

25 Mar 2020  - Did a bit more pages in basic-JS trying to get the practice and lingo down. I know it's basic, but I've always been a little afraid of JS, so I'm trying to conquer that fear.
