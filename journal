24 Mar 2020 - I started the very basic JS in free code camp about two weeks ago. I had only done about 10 out of the 110 then. I wanted to set this up to see how really far I've come. I know that with most of this, I am way more advanced, but it's been nice for the review and the practice. I'll do my best to give 100 days a code a shot. 

25 Mar, Weds  - Did a bit more pages in basic-JS trying to get the practice and lingo down. I know it's basic, but I've always been a little afraid of JS, so I'm trying to conquer that fear.

26 Mar, Thurs - Getting ready to code after a long morning of grocery shopping. (With COVID-19, this is no small feat.) and my son comes in with a torn-up, bloodied knee from a bike accident. Didn't get as much in today as I would have like, but still got some in. 100 days of code, I will get through this!

27 Mar, Fri - Finally reached writing functions in basic JS. Done with basic arrays and feel like I'm moving on to what I could use the practice and mind muscle in. Totally had an a-ha moment. Global scope is like our house number but the variable within that scope is like the members of that household. Not everyone will see it outside the global scope.

28 Mar, Sat - Writing more familiar functions within JS and it feels good to see and practice the basics again. My confidence in finishing and understanding each 'equation' is helpful.

31 Mar, Tues - I've missed a few days; I really try to give myself one day and that is usually Sundays. Yesterday, I nearly completed my resume, which I have been putting off for weeks now. Finally getting into more JS code, that I actually understand more and can debug more on my own. 

1 Apr, Weds  - Today, no joke. Got some JS done with booleans, if/else statements and switch/case. Finally stuff I can use and actually remember. Feels good. 

2 Apr, Thurs - Definitely out of practice. Needing this review.

3 Apr, Fri - Not much done today. With COVID-19, found out the kids are out of school indefinitely until the end of the school year, tomorrow is 7yo b-day and it's Friday. Finally getting to dot notations and brackets [].

4 Apr, Sat - 8yo b-day today and General Conference is on. My favorite two weekends of the year!

6 Apr, Mon - Back to school after two week break, but a great jump start to my JS review and now JSON (JS Object Notation). Gotta get that in my brain!
