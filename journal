24 Mar 2020 - I started the very basic JS in free code camp about two weeks ago. I had only done about 10 out of the 110 then. I wanted to set this up to see how really far I've come. I know that with most of this, I am way more advanced, but it's been nice for the review and the practice. I'll do my best to give 100 days a code a shot. 

25 Mar 2020  - Did a bit more pages in basic-JS trying to get the practice and lingo down. I know it's basic, but I've always been a little afraid of JS, so I'm trying to conquer that fear.

26 Mar 2020 - Getting ready to code after a long morning of grocery shopping. (With COVID-19, this is no small feat.) and my son comes in with a torn-up, bloodied knee from a bike accident. Didn't get as much in today as I would have like, but still got some in. 100 days of code, I will get through this!

27 Mar 2020 - Finally reached writing functions in basic JS. Done with basic arrays and feel like I'm moving on to what I could use the practice and mind muscle in. Totally had an a-ha moment. Global scope is like our house number but the variable within that scope is like the members of that household. Not everyone will see it outside the global scope.
